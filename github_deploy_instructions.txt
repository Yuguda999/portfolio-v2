# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name your repository: "portfolio" or "my-portfolio"
3. Add a description (optional)
4. Make it public
5. Don't initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub
Run these commands in your terminal, replacing YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /home/yms/Development/my_portfolio

# Connect to the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Configure GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select "main" branch
5. Click "Save"
6. Wait a few minutes for your site to be published
7. You'll see a message with the URL where your site is published (usually https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/portfolio/)

## 4. Custom Domain (Optional)
If you want to use a custom domain:
1. In the GitHub Pages section of repository settings
2. Enter your custom domain in the "Custom domain" field
3. Click "Save"
4. Configure your domain's DNS settings as instructed

## 5. Updating Your Portfolio
Whenever you make changes to your portfolio:

```bash
# Add your changes
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

Your site will automatically update after each push.

## Troubleshooting
- If your site doesn't appear, check the GitHub Pages section in repository settings for any error messages
- Make sure your repository is public
- Verify that your HTML files are properly formatted
- The main page should be named index.html
